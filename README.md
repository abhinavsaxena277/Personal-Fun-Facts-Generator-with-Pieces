# Personal-Fun-Facts-Generator-with-Pieces
GenAI 101 with Pieces Workshop

## Overview
The Personal Fun Facts Generator App is a fun, interactive web application that generates random "fun facts" about the user. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to apply the concepts of prompt engineering, context setting, and handling AI limitations (hallucinations) learned in GenAI 101.

## Purpose
This app was designed as a capstone project for the GenAI 101 workshop, allowing participants to:

Understand prompt engineering and context setting.
Recognize and address potential hallucinations in AI-generated content.
Practice creating and customizing a simple, shareable web application using Pieces Copilot and basic web technologies.

## Key Features
Random Fun Fact Generation: Displays a random, user-defined fun fact each time you click the button.
Customizable Facts: Users can personalize the app by adding their own unique facts.
Easy Hosting on GitHub Pages: With no additional setup, users can deploy their app online to share with others.
